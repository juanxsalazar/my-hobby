    <p>One of my new hobbies that I started doing and learning is coding. So far I been learning through Suncoast Developers Guild and I been loving every second of it. It's challenging and rewarding. The challenging part is not knowing the language right away, what's nice though is that we are learning and we can find out the answer online and be able to test it out and see if our solutions work or not. I consider myself a problem solver, I love solving problems so whenever I get stuck, I find it intriguing since it gives me an opportunity to find a solution. 
      <p>As of now (Feb 13th 2019, Wednesday) we have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML is the content of coding such as the text that you are reading. CSS is the design of the page such as the background color. Javascript, well Javascript is one of the languages that allows us to give commands to the computers to do things such as making buttons work and grabbing API's from other websites. So far the biggest thing that I realized I have to work on in order to become greater at coding is to keep on practicing and reviewing the code so that I can have the concepts stick with me and be able to use them whenever I think of a problem to solve.</p>
